Welcome to **Pyversity's** CI/CD Unit Testing Project! This repository demonstrates
how to write clean, testable Python code, adhere to modern CI/CD practices,
and ensure high-quality standards using tools like Ruff, pylint, and unittest.

🚀 **Project Overview**

This project focuses on:

- Writing unit tests for Python functions.

- Passing all Continuous Integration (CI) checks.

- Adopting best practices for linting, formatting, and code quality assurance.

- Managing branches effectively using Git.

_The goal is to demonstrate robust development workflows suitable for professional-grade Python projects._

🧑‍💻 **Technologies Used**

Python: 100% of the codebase.

Our Approach-

1. Code Quality: Automated checks enforce clean and consistent code.

2. Early Bug Detection: CI pipeline identifies issues before merging code.

3. Team Collaboration: Standardized practices make it easier for teams to collaborate.

4. Faster Development: Automating testing and formatting saves time during reviews.
