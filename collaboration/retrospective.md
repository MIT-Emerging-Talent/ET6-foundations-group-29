# Retrospective

## Stop Doing

Spending too much time trying to figure
things out on my own without asking for help sooner.
Overthinking small tasks instead of
just starting and learning along the way.

## Continue Doing

Working step by step and focusing on
one part of the task at a time.
Asking my teammates for advice and
reviewing their work to learn from them.
Using GitHub features like branches
and pull requests to stay organized.

## Start Doing

Practicing math and coding challenges
more often so I can solve them faster in the future.
Writing down notes about what I’m
learning so I can remember it for next time.
Paying more attention to small
details in documentation and instructions.

## Lessons Learned

I realized that working in a team
helps a lot, especially when I don’t know something.
GitHub tools like pull requests and
labels are very useful once you understand how to use them.
Breaking the project into small steps
makes everything easier and less stressful.

## Strategy vs. Board

### What parts of your plan went as expected?

I was able to clone the repository,
create my branch, and push my code.
Submitting a pull request and reviewing
others’ work was smooth and worked as planned.

### What parts of your plan did not work out?

Some of the math problems were harder than
I expected, and I had to spend extra time on them.
I didn’t fully understand the CI checks at
first, so fixing errors took more time.

### Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?

Yes, I had to look up tutorials on GitHub
features like labeling pull requests and managing CI errors.

### Or remove extra steps?

I simplified things by focusing only on the steps
needed to complete the assignment and skipping
any unnecessary experiments with GitHub.
