## **Stop Doing**

- Procrastinating on learning essential tools like Ruff linting and branch management.
- Diving into implementation without fully understanding the requirements or setting up the CI tools properly.

## **Continue Doing**

- Researching and learning new tools and frameworks as needed.
- Writing clean, modular, and testable code for future projects.
- Testing and validating the functionality of code locally before pushing it to CI/CD pipelines.

## **Start Doing**

- Creating a detailed plan or checklist before starting a project to ensure all requirements are understood.
- Using pre-commit hooks to catch linting and formatting issues early.
- Regularly committing changes to the branch to track progress incrementally.

## **Lessons Learned**

- Understanding the CI/CD pipeline and tools like Ruff, pylint, and branch management is critical for project success.
- Proper preparation and configuration save significant time during debugging and fixing errors.
- Unit tests not only validate functionality but also help identify edge cases early.

## **Strategy vs. Board**

**What parts of your plan went as expected?**

- Successfully wrote two unit tests for the required functions.
- Learned the basics of Ruff linting and configured the environment to pass CI checks.

### **What parts of your plan did not work out?**

- Spent more time than expected fixing Ruff linting issues due to lack of initial knowledge.
- Faced challenges while creating and managing branches for the project.

### **Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?**

- Had to spend additional time learning Ruff and its specific linting rules.
- Learned how to configure pre-commit hooks for automating linting and formatting checks.

### **Or remove extra steps?**

- Simplified branch management by sticking to a single feature branch for the task instead of overcomplicating with multiple branches.
- Avoided redundant checks by running all tests and linting together after each major change.
