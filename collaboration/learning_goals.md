# Learning Goals

## Collective

The collective learning goals for a beginner group learning Python include
understanding basic syntax, data types, and control structures, along
with practicing functions, loops, and error handling. Learners
will also explore data structures, file handling, and an
introduction to object-oriented programming to build a solid foundation for coding.
